**Authors**: Minki Lee & Christy Sarmiento

**Date**: April 15, 2021

### Introduction

This is the final project for an advanced visualization course at the University of Calgary. For this project, we performed Natural Language Processing to analyze and extract meaningful insight stored in physical activity-related tweets. We also analyzed Google Trends, Reddit, and the Canadian Institute of Health Information statistical reports to enhance the relevance of our research questions. We aimed to gain valualbe insights and have a better in-depth understanding of how Canadians consider physical activity and behave. Hopefully, this study can be used to target interventions and health promotion efforts to improve Canadians physical activity levels.

### Dataset

The dataset available was a collection of physical activity-related tweets in Canada from October 12, 2019, to December 1, 2019, which was provided by Data Intelligence for Health (DIH) Lab. The raw had 717 columns and 4,696 rows.
