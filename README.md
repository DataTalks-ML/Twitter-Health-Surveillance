# Public Health Surveillance on Physical Activity via Twitter
**Authors**: Minki Lee & Christy Sarmiento

**Date**: April 15, 2021

### Introduction

This is the final project for an advanced visualization course at the University of Calgary. For this project, we performed Natural Language Processing to analyze and extract meaningful insight stored in physical activity-related tweets. We also analyzed Google Trends, Reddit, and the Canadian Institute of Health Information (CIHI) statistical reports to enhance the relevance of our research questions. We aimed to gain valuable insights and have a better in-depth understanding of how Canadians consider physical activity and behave. Hopefully, this study can be used to target interventions and health promotion efforts to improve Canadians physical activity levels.

### Dataset

The dataset available is a collection of Canadian's physical activity-related tweets from October 12, 2019, to December 1, 2019, provided by Data Intelligence for Health (DIH) Lab. The raw dataset has 717 columns and 4,696 rows.

### Project Description

The first phase of this project involved exploring the distribution of self-reported tweets across Canadian provinces as an exploratory analysis using Tableau Prep Builder and Python. We applied supervised machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes and Random Forest to predict whether the tweets were self-reported or not and observe the performance of these machine learning algorithms. Then we performed Natural Language Processing (NLP) in R to build bigrams for visualizing the relationships between words and analyze the overall sentiment of physical activity. To further support our findings and results, we collected supporting datasets from Google Trends, Reddit, and the CIHI to observe the similarities and differences between platforms.
